# asteroids-3d
Vanilla JS Asteroids clone built with ❤️ and low poly 3D graphics, served in just a handful of kilobytes

The rational behind this personal project was to implement the [Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) architecture and grasp the fundamentals of 3D game programming. (Currently lacking some collision detection.)
